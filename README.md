# Analysis of investment data from the TV show Shark Tank U.S.

## Project Description

Shark Tank U.S. is a reality TV show in which entrepreneurs present their ideas and business models to prominent investors, the so-called "Sharks." The aim of the show is to reach a deal in which the sharks invest in the presented company. 

The goal of this project is to use statistical and analytical tools to identify patterns in the Sharks' investments and decisions.

## Data Sources

The following data will be used for analysis:
- [sharktankseason.com](http://sharktankseason.com)
- tbd

## Data Processing and Analysis

The following statistical analyses will be performed:
- What is the overall success rate of pitches, and how does it vary between industries?
- What is the average investment amount per deal, and how does this vary between industries?
- Which sectors do the individual Sharks prefer to invest in?
- Which combinations of Sharks most often invest together?
- Which factors (e.g., sector, required amount, company valuation) increase the probability of a deal?
- Are there differences in the success rate depending on the geographical origin of the entrepreneurs?
- How are investments distributed across different business models (products, services, software)?
- Do teams of entrepreneurs have a higher success rate than individuals?
- How big is the difference between the required and actually accepted company valuations?
- Which sectors are most frequently presented on the show, and which are the most successful?

## Methodology

The following steps will be carried out for the analysis:
1. Data Cleansing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Statistical Analyses
4. Visualization of Results

## Expected Results

This project aims to provide insights into the factors that influence the success of a pitch and which sectors or strategies are preferred. Additionally, patterns in the Sharks' investment decisions will be identified.
